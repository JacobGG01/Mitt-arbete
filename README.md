# Menu Ai

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Do you have a fully stocked pantry but no ideas for what to eat for the week? With Menu AI, you can input the ingredients you have, and it will generate the number of dishes depending on how many you need. By matching the ingredients you have at home with recipes available on the internet, Menu AI selects some that suit you.


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

Why you need Menu AI:
* Gives you new ideas for food.
* Save your precious time.
* Reduce food waste and use what you have at home.


## How is it used?

Start by quickly jotting down the ingredients you have at home. Then just let Menu AI assist. It's for anyone who cooks and lacks ideas. It saves the user's time and makes use of the purchased goods. This can help reduce food waste.


This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
